  <h2 class="title">Journey from 0 to 20: From Dreams to Engineering</h2>

  <p>I was born on <strong class="highlight-date">2062-05-07 BS</strong> in the beautiful district of <strong class="highlight-place">Nawalparasi</strong>. At the age of three, my family moved to <strong class="highlight-place2">Butwal</strong>, where my new journey began.</p>

  <h3 class="subtitle">Early Schooling and Interests</h3>
  <p>I started my education at <em class="highlight-school1">Namuna English Boarding High School</em> in Tilottama-7 Bewori, where I studied up to the 10th grade. Later, I joined <em class="highlight-school2">Rammani Multiple College</em> to pursue my +2 in Computer Science.</p>
  <p>Back then, I didn‚Äôt even own a laptop ‚Äî I bought my first one in the middle of 11th grade. But that didn‚Äôt stop me; I had a clear goal to achieve something meaningful.</p>

  <h3 class="subtitle">Discovering My Passion</h3>
  <p>Growing up, I loved cricket and playing mobile games. But I always wondered: <em class="highlight-question">How are these websites and games built? Who creates them? How much do they earn?</em> This curiosity planted the seed for my tech journey.</p>

  <h3 class="subtitle">Challenges and Realizations</h3>
  <p>During my +2 studies, I didn‚Äôt learn much beyond the syllabus, and I realized I needed to push myself further. I decided to become a computer engineer ‚Äî a decision that changed everything.</p>

  <h3 class="subtitle">Taking the Next Step</h3>
  <p>I prepared for the IOE entrance exam and was thrilled to secure the <strong class="highlight-rank">416th rank</strong>. I chose <em class="highlight-campus">Purwanchal Campus</em> to pursue my dreams.</p>

  <h3 class="subtitle">Learning and Growing</h3>
  <p>Since then, I have been diving deep into web development, focusing on the <strong class="highlight-tech">MERN stack</strong>. I‚Äôve learned many powerful tools and technologies like <em class="highlight-tech-tools">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap</em>. Currently, I‚Äôm in my second semester, excited about the journey ahead and eager to build amazing things.</p>

  <p><strong class="highlight-conclusion">This is just the beginning of my story ‚Äî a story of curiosity, persistence, and growth.</strong></p>
